        This Python program automates the process of fetching student result data from the MDU result portal using Selenium. It performs the following tasks:

            1.Setup: Configures the Selenium WebDriver with Chrome options to suppress unnecessary logs.
            2.Navigation: Opens the MDU result portal.
            3.Data Input: Iterates through a list of student details (Registration No and Roll No), enters them into the respective fields on the portal, and submits the form.
            4.Data Extraction: Extracts student information such as name, father's name, total marks, and reappear status from the result page.
            5.Error Handling: Handles exceptions during the process and logs errors for specific students.
            6.Output: Stores the fetched data in a list of dictionaries and displays it in a formatted manner.
            7.Notification: Shows a success message once all data is fetched.
            8.Cleanup: Closes the browser after completing the task.
